# PADL33 CSE1012

Arduino code that lets it model a PADL33 flight computer, assuming a bunch of additional modules are also attached to it.

This code specifically also managed 8 extra thermistors, for an experiment examining how different colors of paint would absorb light differently in near-space conditions.
